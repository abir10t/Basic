### OOP

-  Encapsulation : Encapsulation is a mechanism of wrapping the variables and methods together as a single unit. In encapsulation, the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes, and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class. Therefore, it is also known as data hiding.

- Method overloading: method overloding is the process of overloading the method that has the same name but different parameters.
