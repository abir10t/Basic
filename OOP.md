### OOP

-  `Encapsulation` : Encapsulation is a mechanism of wrapping the variables and methods together as a single unit. In encapsulation, the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes, and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class. Therefore, it is also known as data hiding.

- `Method overloading`:  method overloding is the process of overloading the method that has the same name but different parameters.

- `Method Overriding` : If child class has the same method as declared in the parent class, it is known as method overriding.The method must have the same name as in the parent class. The method must have the same parameter as in the parent class.There must be an IS-A relationship (inheritance).

- `Abstraction` :  abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details from the user, only the functionality will be provided to the user

- `Inheritance` can be defined as the process where one class acquires the properties (methods and fields) of another.

- A `constructor` is a special type of member function of a class which initializes objects of a class. In C++, Constructor is automatically called when object(instance of class) create. It is special member function of the class because it does not have any return type.
- Data Abstraction can be achieved in two ways:
- Abstraction using classes: An abstraction can be achieved using classes. A class is used to group all the data members and member functions into a single unit by using the access specifiers. A class has the responsibility to determine which data member is to be visible outside and which is not.

- `Abstraction` in header files : An another type of abstraction is header file. For example, pow() function available is used to calculate the power of a number without actually knowing which algorithm function uses to calculate the power. Thus, we can say that header files hides all the implementation details from the user.
